For the next four months most of my time will be going into the [rideable hexapod robot](http://rideablehexapod.eventbrite.com/) class at [Artisan's Asylum](http://artisansasylum.com/).  We'll be working to build a 1-2 ton hydraulic rideable 6-legged robot with a 12 foot legspan.

There are so many awesome things to do and to learn on this project that I had a tough time figuring out which part I wanted to work on.  I started off on the mechanical team welding together a cart for the test leg, but switched this week to the controls team.  I'll be writing the PID controller for the joints.  I'm sure I'll have more chances later on to get my metalworking fix in, and I'm really hoping to have a chance to work with hydraulics at some point.

You can follow our progress over at the [Project Hexapod blog](http://projecthexapod.com/blog/)!

When I first saw this photo I was disappointed that it was just a sculpture, because I really wanted to think that something like that was walking around the earth somewhere.  Now I'm building something even more badass, and I'll get to ride it!
