I stumbled across a set of rules for a 3D chess variant called [Raumschach](http://www.chessvariants.com/3d.dir/3d5.html).  The board is 5 x 5 squares by 5 boards, making a 5 x 5 x 5 cube of spaces.  Pieces move in any plane as they normally would in the single plane of regular chess.  Raumschach has an extra piece called the Unicorn that moves on the 3D diagonals.  After reading about it, I immediately wanted to try it, and that meant I would have to build myself a board.

I started off by cutting five Plexiglass squares.  I used a tablesaw with the blade height set low to score lines for the squares in each board.  I used electrical tape to mask off every other square before sandblasting the board.  I drilled holes in the corners to fit 8-32 threaded rod, and took all the parts home.  Leah helped me assemble the pieces into a pretty decent looking Raumschach board.

We finished putting it together late last night and didn't have time for a game.  I can't wait to play it!
