The hexapod robot is making the news!  We've shown up on [Wired.com](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/05/stompy-project-hexapod/), [hackaday](http://hackaday.com/2012/05/03/meet-stompy-your-new-robotic-overlord/), [slashdot](http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/12/05/02/179221/ma-hackerspace-building-rideable-hexapod), [BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/2012/05/02/stompy-is-coming.html) and a few others.



Gui rendered a concept model that gives a good idea of what the robot is going to look like:

Right now, I'm working on the PID controller for the joint actuators.  I've got a bare-bones PID algorithm working and I'm going to add a few more features to make it a little more robust.
