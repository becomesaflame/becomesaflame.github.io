I'm still catching up on posting a couple of older projects here.

Back in December, Artisan's Asylum ran their second annual Do-It-Yourself Secret Santa event.  Participants filled out a brief survey about their interests, and their secret Santa made something for them based on their survey results.

Here's the wire sailboat I made for Max Eskin.  I spot welded most of it and TIG welded a few spots I couldn't get with the spot welder.  I probably spent as much time tying the sails on as I spent welding the rest of the ship.

Leah made a wire flower/candle holder for Bronwen.  When the candle is lit, it throws beautiful shadows on the walls and makes you feel like you're sitting in a jungle.

Ecco made me this kickass glow-in-the-dark kitty skeleton out of Sculpey and wire.

Bevan made a sculpture for Leah.  One of the questions on the survey asked where/when you would go if you had a time machine that would only work once.  Leah wrote that she would go somewhere where she could float on her back in the ocean with her eyes closed on a beautiful sunny day, and Bevan made something to remind her of that feeling.
