The hammock is finished!  I ended up weaving it myself.  I made a shuttle out of scrap masonite to hold the bulk of the rope while I wove it through the loops.  I'm glad I decided to make the net myself rather than buying one.  The process was relaxing and meditative, and the result is much more satisfying.  It took about ten hours to weave the whole net.

I attached the net by spiraling rope through the loops at each edge and around the 4x4 at the top of the hammock structure.

The final product is comfy and has more than enough room for five people.  I'd like to put some pipe insulation or cut up pool noodles on the inside corner of the 4x4 at the top to make it a nice place to rest your head, but other than that it's complete!
