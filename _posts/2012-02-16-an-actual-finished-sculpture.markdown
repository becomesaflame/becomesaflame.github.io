After a year of off and on work, I finally completed my first kinetic metal sculpture.  It's a flower that blooms when the temperature rises above ~70 degrees F.  Check out the photo series below of it opening up, along with my full description below.

<blockquote>Flos Metallica is a rare specimen of plant life from the year 3072. It was collected via a wormhole left unguarded by the benevolent robot overlords (all hail his mightiness Omnicron Prime!) The flower blooms only when the temperature exceeds 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

Flos Metallica uses a cylinder from a greenhouse vent to actuate the petals of the flower. Wax inside the cylinder expands when it is heated, forcing the piston upwards. A spring is needed to retract the piston as the wax cools.</blockquote>
