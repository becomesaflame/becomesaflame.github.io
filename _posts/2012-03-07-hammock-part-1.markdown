Mom and Dad came up last Saturday to help me put together the hammock structure for my space.  I've had the plans for this thing since October, so it was great to finally buckle down and get it done.  Thanks to Leah and Andrew Kessel for stopping by to lend a hand!

The hammock will be a rectangular grid that fits across the top.  I'm waiting on some samples from cargo net suppliers, but there's a good chance I'll end up making it by hand with knotted rope.  Cargo nets are expensive!
