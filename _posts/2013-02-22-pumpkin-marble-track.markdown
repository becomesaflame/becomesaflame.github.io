Wow, I've been terrible at updating this blog lately!  That's partly because I haven't finished very many projects in a while, and partly because I keep forgetting to post the projects I have completed.  I'm gonna catch up with a few old projects and then give some updates on what I'm working on now.

Back in October, I got to carve giant pumpkins with power tools along with a handful of other artists from Artisan's Asylum.  I decided to turn mine into a marble track.  Check it out!

Here's a video of it in action:

Check out the rest of the pumpkins [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dreamexplorer/8142663530/in/set-72157631897745479/).  They're all fantastic!
