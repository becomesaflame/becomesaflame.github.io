Last week I entered the [Trebuchet Competition](http://artisansasylum.com/?p=1991) at Artisan's Asylum!  Nick Anastasia, Alex Phillips and I made up team Percussive Maintenance.  We spent a week from Sunday April 22 to Sunday April 29 designing and building our trebuchet, the Small Adjustment Tool.  Artisan's Asylum provided a pile of lumber and assorted hardware, and we had a week to come up with a trebuchet that would throw water balloons with a maximum counterweight of 100lbs at targets set up on Cambridge Commons.

There were a couple other floating arm trebuchets, but ours was the only arm-slides-over-cam style.  We were looking great in testing with a range of at least 150' and good consistency between shots.

At the competition, we had a couple shots to calibrate our trebuchet, then ten shots to hit the first target twice.  The targets were plywood castles, set up at 50' for the first round.  Our first calibration shot went a little long, so we pulled some weight off and tried again.  The next two shots were dead on target.  Figuring we were all set, we went ahead with our ten shots for the qualifying round - and not one hit the target!  They were going all over the place, landing anywhere from 10 feet to 100 feet in front of us.  The only thing we can think of is that the wind and unevenly filled water balloons combined to add a lot of variability.

Even though we lost in the first round, we had a great time and built a really cool trebuchet.  Overall, I'd call it a win!
